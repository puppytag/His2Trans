# Minimal Python dependencies for running the framework in external API mode
# (USE_VLLM=false) and without GPU-heavy components (e.g., Jina reranker).
#
# Tested with Python 3.11.
#
# Note:
# - System deps like clang/libclang and Rust toolchain are NOT included here.
# - For full-feature setup (RAG reranker / local vLLM), prefer conda:
#   `bash framework/setup_conda_env.sh`
